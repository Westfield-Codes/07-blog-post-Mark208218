                            <p>Don't Google "Hooked Eyeball Injury" but instead ask yourself: why did bloggers (and now, social media posters) speak of hooking eyeballs? </p>
                            <p>Obviously, before a blog reader or social media user decides whether to read a post, they first need to notice it and decide they care about it. The image, title and lede of the post must grab the interest of those who will read the rest - and if it is sufficiently engaging, like, comment, and boost traffic.</p>
                            <h4>Blog History</h4>
                            <p>Before Insta and Snap, before Facebook, were the Blogs: "web logs" that served as open diaries or journals. Blogs got really big after WordPress, which let people create and share commentable blogs for free. This is why over 25% of all websites are made with Wordpress now.</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <h4>Nothing is Free</h4>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>Time is money (if you weren't reading this blog you could be making money doing something else) and attention can be bought (and sold). Advertisers might, for example, put an ad for fishing lures here, because the hero image of the post and the concept of eyeballs and hooks made them think it would attract fishermen.</p>
                            <h4>Sticky Flowers</h4>
                            <p>Bloggers who initially thought that their knowledge and opinions would be enough to build a following quickly learned that posts were like flowers: they had to attract attention from bees flying by and get them to land, then get them to walk around inside to stick pollen to the bees' legs. </p>
                            <p>In blog and social media post  language, a post is "sticky" if it gets people to stay and engage with it. If people see the page, scan briefly, and then leave before spending time there, they have "bounced". Which of these two posts would you more likely stick to, and which would you bounce from? </p>
                            <h4>How to Become an Influencer</h4>
                            <p>Want to build traffic to your blog or followers to your social account? Follow three rules with every post:</p>
                          <ol>
                             <li> 
                               <strong>Hook eyeballs</strong> so they stop and read with:
                               <ul>
                                <li>An eye-catching image</li>
                                <li>A matching headline (title)</li>
                               </ul>
                             </li>
                             <li> 
                               <strong>Engage readers</strong> with a short lede paragraph:
                               <ul>
                                <li>Tie the image and title to a reader's interest.</li>
                                <li>Shift into what you want to write about.</li>
                               </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li> 
                               <strong>Be sticky, not bouncy:</strong>
                               <ul>
                                <li>Don’t be clickbaity (break a promise made by the hero image, title and lede by writing about something different).They'll bounce (leave the page).  Social media readers scroll, but blog readers click away. </li>
                                <li>Don’t bore readers with too many details too soon, or hit them with a wall of text (which few readers will dive into).</li>
                                <li>Stay "sticky" with a blend of text, lists and images that feel valuable and keep them reading.</li>
                               </ul>
                            </li>
                          </ol>
                            <p>If your readers stay to the end, harvest that traffic: prompt for comments with a specific question.  Make it easy for readers to want to say something in response. </p>
                            <h4>What Do You Think?</h4>
